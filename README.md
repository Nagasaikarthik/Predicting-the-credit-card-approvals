# Predicting-the-credit-card-approvals
In this project, I built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

Steps to be followed for predicting the credit card approvals:

1.Importing the Libraries 
2.Loading the Necessary dataset from UCI or Kaggale
3.Performing the DataPreprocessing steps
4.Splitting the dataset into train test split
5.Handling the missing values 
6.Following the preprocessing steps again 
7.Fitting the models (5- classification algorithms)into the dataset
a.LogisticRegression 
b.DecisionTree
c.randomForest
d.SupportVectorMachine 
e.K-NearestNeighbours
8.Making the predictions of the models using metrics
9.Visualizing the predictions of models using the matplotlib and seaborn
10.plotting the heatmap and comapring the models 
11.Predicting the Best Model by visualizing the Bargraph
